# Cyberflix Bug Testing Taskforce Operations Reference
!!! note Note

    Intended for Cyberflix Taskforce Members
    This is a reference manual, questions should asked via Discord Channels

## Purpose
The Cyberflix Bug Testing Taskforce is intended to assist and test in the operations of the Cyberflix Media Center. Each Member abides by the guidelines laid out by Administration (see [Guidelines](https://docs.cyberflix.io/cbttf/guidelines)). Taskforce Members are on call to assist Administration in various functions and work with Administration while fulfilling assigned tasks. The Cyberflix Bug Testing Taskforce operates to ensure a safe, secure, and functional operation of the Cyberflix Media Center. They are volunteers in service to the Cyberflix Community and Administration.

## Leadership and Administration
The Cyberflix Bug Testing Taskforce is operated as a function of Cyberflix Media, thus it is headed by Administration and is at the behest of BobDaGecko. The various tasks fulfilled are assigned only by BobDaGecko. BobDaGecko and Administration have the authority to dismiss Taskforce Members at anytime in accordance with the Guidelines of the Cyberflix Bug Testing Taskforce.

The Cyberflix Bug Testing Taskforce Director is a non-administrative leadership role assigned to a senior member of the Taskforce. They work with BobDaGecko and Administration to see that tasks are completed and fulfilled to their full purpose. They have no disciplinary authority, however they can recommend dismissal for a Taskforce Member.

Leadership has full authority over Taskforce Members and deserve respect. Malfeasance and disrespect will be met with appropriate disciplinary action up to termination of a Member's Cyberflix Account.

## Testing Operations
Taskforce Members take part in heavy testing. Upon approval of a Taskforce Member's application, they are assigned a CBTTF account and badge. These accounts give full access to all Cyberflix libraries and the Ombi Request System. From there a Taskforce Member should begin using the various services and testing various functions. Below is a list of testing operations available to Taskforce Members including but not limited to:

### Jellyfin
 - Accessing Jellyfin via the different clients. Taskforce Members should install and access Jellyfin through all Clients available to them. A list of available Jellyfin Clients can be found [here](https://jellyfin.org/clients/).
 - Exploring Jellyfin menus and libraries. Taskforce Members should explore the Jellyfin Menus for bugs and inconsistences in branding and theme. They should keep an eye out for odd colors of elements, missing text, the Jellyfin logo, the Cyberflix logo (as requested to be reported). They should also look for bugs. These include, links or buttons taking the user to an unexpected result, broken links and buttons, missing menus, and unexpected results from use.
 - Watching content. Taskforce Members should watch content in all the libraries. They should look out for poor quality and/or performance, subtitles absent, wrong, or not working, duplicates of content, missing episodes, and wrong title art.
 - Testing Syncplay. BobDaGecko and/or the Taskforce Director will create a party to test Syncplay. In these tests, Taskforce Members will watch content with the intent of testing Syncplay. The Taskforce Director will report to BobDaGecko on the results of this session incase of BobDaGecko's absence.
 - Various other duties will be assigned by BobDaGecko as needed.

### Ombi

!!! note Note

    This software is still under heavy development. Not only will reports go to BobDaGecko but also to the Ombi development team if necessary. 

 - Exploring Ombi menus. Taskforce Members should explore the Ombi Menus and keep an eye out for bugs. Members should keep an eye out for links or buttons taking the user to an unexpected result, broken links and buttons, missing menus, and unexpected results from use.
 - Ombi has little custom theming done but Members should spot for inconsistencies.
 - Testing requests. Taskforce Members will work heavily with BobDaGecko in developing the request system. They must be available for the full time a request takes to be fulfilled and will verify the process on their end as the process progresses.

### Discord

 - Notifying BobDaGecko to unauthorized access to restricted channels. Taskforce Members must keep an eye out for channels that they have access to that should be restricted. Such channels must be reported immediately.
 - Using channels. Taskforce Members must use channels for their purpose. They are to promote usage of the Discord and promote and attract to usage from Cyberflix Members.
 - Reporting misconduct. As any Cyberflix Member should do, Taskforce Members must report misconduct immediately and without hesitation. Failure to do so will result in dismissal and termination of Membership if appropriate.

BobDaGecko may request testing for various other services. Taskforce Members must be on call for this and failure for the entire Taskforce to turn down a request may result in dismissal of current members. The Taskforce is meant for testing and it is imperative it lives up to this purpose. For further guidelines to Taskforce conduct, see see [Guidelines](https://docs.cyberflix.io/cbttf/guidelines).
