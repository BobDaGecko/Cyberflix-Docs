A member is any registered user of the Cyberflix Media Center who has had their application accepted. They have full access to the Media Center and have full authorization to the Frontend. They are the only group who these terms and conditions apply too. The Cyberflix Media Center holds no hierarchical system among its members meaning no member holds any authority over another member.

The Cyberflix Media Center is made up of two halves. The Frontend and the Backend. The Frontend is any site accessible by any member of the Server. The Backend is every site that makes up the backbone of the Server. The Backend makes up the administrative and media management parts of the Server. The Backend is inaccessible to any normal member of the Server.

A program, application, server, or site represents any project in use by the Cyberflix Media Center. Each holds a different definition. A program is any project that is either a backbone to applications, servers, or sites, or an independent project used for a technical purpose. An application is any project that is either on the Backend or Frontend that has a user interface. A server is any program that hosts individual clients per user or session. A site is any program that is forwarded and hosted on the internet. Multiple programs may hold multiple definitions.

The Network Stack is the compilation of all programs, applications, and sites used by the Cyberflix Media Center. The entire Network Stack is not accessible to all users and is only used to represent the technical side of the Server. Please see [here](https://docs.cyberflix.io/about/license/) for licensing.
